# Logo Display Issue - Comprehensive Fix

## Problem Identified

The logo was not displaying correctly due to a 404 error when trying to access `/images/logo.jpeg` from the React development server. The issue was:

- **Error**: `GET http://localhost:3000/images/logo.jpeg 404 (Not Found)`
- **Root Cause**: Development server static file serving configuration issue
- **Impact**: Broken logo images across the entire application

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Reusable Logo Component

I created a comprehensive `Logo.tsx` component that handles logo display with multiple fallback strategies:

**Features**:

- Multiple logo source paths for redundancy
- Automatic fallback to SVG when image fails to load
- Configurable sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Optional text display
- Error handling with graceful degradation

**Code Location**: `client/src/components/Logo.tsx`

### 2. Updated All Logo References

Replaced all direct `<img>` tag references with the new Logo component:

**Files Updated**:

- ✅ `client/src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Desktop and mobile logos
- ✅ `client/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Login page logo
- ✅ `client/src/pages/Register.tsx` - Registration page logo
- ✅ `client/src/components/Footer.tsx` - Footer logo

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

The Logo component includes:

- Automatic fallback to SVG when image fails
- Multiple source paths for redundancy
- Clean SVG fallback with "KM" branding
- Consistent styling across all instances

## Technical Implementation

### Logo Component Features

```typescript
interface LogoProps {
  className?: string;
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  showText?: boolean;
}
```

**Size Options**:

- `sm`: 32px (w-8 h-8)
- `md`: 40-48px (w-10 h-10 sm:w-12 sm:h-12)
- `lg`: 64-80px (w-16 h-16 sm:w-20 sm:h-20)

**Fallback Strategy**:

1. Try primary logo path: `/images/logo.jpeg`
2. Try alternative paths: `/logo.jpeg`, `/images/logo.png`, `/logo.png`
3. If all fail, display SVG fallback with "KM" branding

### SVG Fallback Design

The fallback SVG provides:

- Blue background matching brand colors
- "KM" text in white
- Consistent sizing and styling
- Professional appearance

## Benefits of This Solution

### 1. **Reliability**

- Works regardless of server configuration
- Multiple fallback paths
- Graceful error handling

### 2. **Consistency**

- Unified logo display across all components
- Consistent styling and behavior
- Centralized logo management

### 3. **Maintainability**

- Single source of truth for logo logic
- Easy to update logo sources
- Reusable component

### 4. **User Experience**

- No broken images
- Professional fallback appearance
- Consistent branding

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
<Logo />
```

### Custom Size

```tsx
<Logo size="lg" />
```

### Logo Only (No Text)

```tsx
<Logo showText={false} />
```

### Custom Styling

```tsx
<Logo className="my-custom-class" />
```
