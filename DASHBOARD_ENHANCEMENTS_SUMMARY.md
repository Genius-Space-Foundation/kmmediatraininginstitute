## Overview

This document summarizes all the enhancements made to both the Student and Admin Dashboards to support the new payment system that distinguishes between application fees (one-time payment to apply for a course) and course fees (actual training fees payable in installments).

- **Installment Plans Section**: New tabbed interface to view and manage course fee installment plans
- **Payment Progress Tracking**: Displays installment progress, remaining balance, and next due dates
- **Improved Payment Details**: Shows installment numbers, total installments, and remaining balances

#### Data Structure Updates:

```typescript
interface Payment {
  id: number;
  courseName: string;
