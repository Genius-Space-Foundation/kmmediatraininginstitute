## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

#### AssignmentSubmissionModal

```typescript
interface AssignmentSubmissionModalProps {
  assignment: Assignment;
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onSubmissionSuccess: () => void;
}
```

**Key Functions:**

- `handleFileChange()`: Manages file selection
- `handleSubmit()`: Processes form submission
- `formatDate()`: Formats due dates
- Validation logic for form completeness

#### StudentCourseView Integration

```typescript
const [selectedAssignment, setSelectedAssignment] = useState<Assignment | null>(
  null
);
const [showSubmissionModal, setShowSubmissionModal] = useState(false);

const handleSubmitAssignment = (assignment: Assignment) => {
  setSelectedAssignment(assignment);
  setShowSubmissionModal(true);
};
```

### Backend API

#### Submission Endpoint

```typescript
POST /api/courses/assignments/:assignmentId/submit
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "submissionText": "Student's written response",
  "fileUrl": "https://example.com/uploads/file.pdf",
  "fileName": "assignment.pdf"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Assignment submitted successfully",
  "data": {
    "submission": {
      "id": 1,
      "assignmentId": 1,
      "studentId": 1,
      "submissionText": "...",
      "fileUrl": "...",
      "fileName": "...",
      "submittedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

### Database Schema

#### assignment_submissions Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE assignment_submissions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  "assignmentId" INTEGER REFERENCES assignments(id),
  "studentId" INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  "submissionText" TEXT,
  "fileUrl" VARCHAR(500),
  "fileName" VARCHAR(255),
  "submittedAt" TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
