# Student Course View Solution

## Problem

When students clicked "View Course" from their "My Courses" page, they were being directed to the general course detail page instead of seeing the course materials, assignments, and quizzes that their trainer had created.

## Solution

Created a dedicated student course view page that shows:

- Course materials (documents, videos, files)
- Assignments with due dates and submission status
- Quizzes with attempt limits and scores
- Student progress tracking
- Access control based on registration approval

## Implementation

### 1. New Student Course View Page

**File:** `client/src/pages/StudentCourseView.tsx`

**Features:**

- **Tabbed Interface**: Materials, Assignments, and Quizzes tabs
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows completion status for each item
- **Access Control**: Only shows content if student has approved registration
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for overdue assignments, completed items, etc.

### 2. Updated Routing

**File:** `client/src/App.tsx`

**New Route:**

```typescript
<Route
  path="/student/courses/:id"
  element={
    <PrivateRoute>
      <StudentCourseView />
    </PrivateRoute>
  }
/>
```

### 3. Updated Dashboard Link

**File:** `client/src/pages/ModernStudentDashboard.tsx`

**Changed from:**

```typescript
<Link to={`/courses/${course.courseId}`}>
```

**Changed to:**

```typescript
<Link to={`/student/courses/${course.courseId}`}>
```
